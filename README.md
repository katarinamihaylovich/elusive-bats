## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a social media app with a travel theme so that users would be able to log their travels. Through the use of React, GraphQL, Node, Express, and MongoDB, I was able to create a fully functional single-page MERN app. The application follows conventional file-structuring through React. The front-end consists of various components, including a Navigation bar that provides the following options: Home, Profile, Sign Up, Log In, and Log Out. The back-end was constructed through the use of MongoDB and GraphQL. Overall, though the app could use some enhancements, I was successful in my creation of a data-based website using all of the aforementioned components. As far as learning goes, I cemented my understanding of back-end components such as models, schemas, and authentication, as well as front-end components such as page-creation, mutations, and queries. I also learned a lot (the hard way) about deploying to Heroku, and that is an instrumental take-away.
